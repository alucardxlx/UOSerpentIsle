Instead of having people manually type in their client version, consider this:
This code snippet will automatically show the player their client version # in your gump

CLIENT VERSION
------------------------------------------------
//Make The Method Look Like This:
public GumpName(Mobile from): base(0, 0)
{

//Copy This Under The Method Above:
NetState ns = from.NetState;
ClientVersion v = ns.Version;

//Place This In The Body Of The Gump:
AddLabel(0, 0, 0, @"Client Version:");
AddLabel(0, 0, 0, v == null ? "(null)" : v.ToString());

//To Call Gump From NPC Or Item Code:
from.SendGump(new AccountLogin(from));

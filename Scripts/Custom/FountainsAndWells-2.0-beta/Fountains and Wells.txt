Fountains and Wells by Alari (alarihyena@gmail.com)


MagicFountain - A "magic" fountain, though it will
 be non-magical when first placed, must be set
 magic = true by a Game Master or better. Once "magic",
 you can toss coins into it and get valuable
 prizes. ;)  (these vary depending on the type of
 fountain.)  All MagicFountains, whether the magical
 bit is set or not, give special messages when drunk
 from, and have a very slight chance of refilling a
 character's health, mana, or stamina (the player will
 see a longer 'fill' message when this happens)

  FountainMessage.Cool: Gives gold (two tries)
  FountainMessage.Warm: Gives a random item, or gold.
  FountainMessage.Clean: Gives a random food, or gold.
  FountainMessage.Calm: Gives a pet horse, or gold.
  FountainMessage.Fruit: Gives a random fruit, or gold.

 To toss a coin, left-click on a magic=true fountain
 and choose "Activate"

 Some of the food items may be from the Better Food and
 Cooking package.

WellAddon - Based off the well in Ilsh. You know the
 one I'm talking about. This isn't magical at all.
 The WellBucket can be added seperately, in
 case.. you.. need.. a bucket. (It's not movable but
 is drinkable-from. I put one in each jail cell so
 players don't die of thirst. Aren't I nice? =)

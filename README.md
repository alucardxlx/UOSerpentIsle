This is a fork of [ServUO](https://github.com/ServUO/ServUO) for UO Serpent Isle.

## UO Serpent Isle

A freeshard for Ultima Online with a map of the Serpent Isle from Ultima 7 part 2 replacing the Ilshenar facet. More details regarding this project can be found at our website: http://www.uoserpentisle.com

### Customizations

There are two folders where the majority of the custom scripts can be found. 

Scripts/Custom holds plug-and-play scripts I've dropped in from other sources. These run with few changes for compatability or personalization to the shard.

Scripts/SerpentIsle holds both fully-custom scripts and plug-and-play scripts that needed extensive modification to compile. 

### Progress/Roadmap

1. Remake the 1993 Serpent Isle map in Ultima Online.
  -All terrain has been rescaled and converted to Ultima Online, occupying a large portion of the Ilshenar facet. This includes the highway. A detail pass was done to cleanup some generation errors and shorelines.
  -Dungeons such as the Dreamlands and the Dark Path have been converted as well.
  - A lore-friendly starting camp and character creation sequence have been constructed, located to the northeast of Vesper.
  -Overland passages have been added to mountain ranges where such geography was impossible in the '93 game. This does not interfere with existing undermountain geography.
  -Monitor, Fawn, Moonshade, Monk Isle and Sleeping Bull have their first floors mapped out. A second pass is planned to add second floors and roofing.
  -Big castles(White Dragon / Shamino) are underway.
  -Undercities such as Spinebreaker, Skullcrusher, and Furnace.
  -Dungeons such as the Mountains of Freedom, the Knight's Test, ice caves and the Goblin Tunnels.
  -Minor locations on the map, such as Erstam's Isle, the portal beside Gorlab, Gorlab itself, etc.
  -Second/Roofing pass for the major cities.
  -Sunrise Isle.
  -Final detail pass for cleanup/shorelines.
  
2. Add functionality and NPCs.
  -Add NPCs to each of the cities.
  -Add fauna, goblins, etc to overland map.
  -Implement gameplay systems per 'tech corner' forum.
  
3. Testing and Balancing

4. General Beta

5. Release

This is a fork of [ServUO](https://github.com/ServUO/ServUO) for UO Serpent Isle.

## UO Serpent Isle

A freeshard for Ultima Online with a map of the Serpent Isle from Ultima 7 part 2 replacing the Ilshenar facet. More details regarding this project can be found at our website: http://www.uoserpentisle.com

### Changes

There are two folders where the majority of the custom scripts can be found. 

Scripts/Custom holds plug-and-play scripts I've dropped in from other sources. These run with few changes for compatability or personalization to the shard.

Scripts/SerpentIsle holds both fully-custom scripts and plug-and-play scripts that needed extensive modification to compile. 

A more detailed list of changes will follow.
